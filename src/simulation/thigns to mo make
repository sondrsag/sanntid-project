make config_file with ip adresses of participants
in elcom_init read this config_file
add call for elcom_init

#FILE STRUCTURE:
List of ip adresses:ports

as a first attempt we can hardcode it

ask elevatorcontrol to send elevator status periodically, define time in globals.h - it will be used to identify if elevator is dead or not, if no updates comming overcertain time, elevator is treated as dead.

make such check inside Workerthread of elcom?

define Primary - elevator with lower ip which is alive, for instance

in communication module create function returning local_assignee_id - required for wd_module
plus, another function which converts ip into assignee_id <-i.e., from 0,1 or 2


elcom_broadcastElevatorStatus <- this function broadcast should contain information which elevator it is!

in work_distribution create function similar to wd_reveiceJob but to receive job externally
it should have one more parameter which is el_id, so that internal calls are assigned to correct place in massive!!

I will combine this function inside wd, or basically core routines will be similar
